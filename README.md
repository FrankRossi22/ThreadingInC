# ThreadingInC
Basic threading examples done in C

## How It Works
All 3 parallel files use different threading techniques to sum an array of integers.
parallel1.c uses threading with no locks
parallel2.c uses threading with locks 
parallel3.c uses threading with a slightly more efficient locking mechanism
